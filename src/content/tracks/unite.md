(Verse 1)
I was chilling one morning they came knocking on my door for war
I was relaxing one morning they came knocking on my door for fight
Help me tell them we don't wanna war
Help me tell them we don't wanna fight
Lions in the jungle are united Africans why are we fighting
Animal's in the jungle are united brother's why are we fighting


(Chorus)
Let's Unite Iye oh oh let's Unite, let's Unite
Let's Unite Iye oh oh let's Unite, let's Unite
Let's Unite Iye oh oh let's Unite, let's Unite
Let's Unite Iye oh oh let's Unite, let's Unite


(Verse 2)
African's say no to war
Europe say no to war
American's say no to war
Let's Unite let they be peace
African's say no to war
Ukraine say no to war
Russian say no to war
Let's Unite let they be peace
Listen when two elephants are fighting remember that the grasses always suffer
When two elephants are fighting remember ant will not survive


(Chorus)
Let's Unite Iye oh oh let's Unite, let's Unite
Let's Unite Iye oh oh let's Unite, let's Unite
Let's Unite Iye oh oh let's Unite, let's Unite
Let's Unite Iye oh oh let's Unite, let's Unite


(Verse 3)
What's your problem African leaders don't you know that life is too short
What's your problem show some love you and I are the same
I need equal right and justice
I need equal right and justice
Listen when two elephants are fighting remember that the grasses always suffer
When two elephants are fighting remember ant will not survive


(Chorus)
Let's Unite Iye oh oh let's Unite, let's Unite
Let's Unite Iye oh oh let's Unite, let's Unite
Let's Unite Iye oh oh let's Unite, let's Unite
Let's Unite Iye oh oh let's Unite, let's Unite
