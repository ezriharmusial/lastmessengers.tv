quote: Whiteman buys land in Gborokiri [Port Harcourt]
description: O'laga Port is creative Langwa rap (messages) through which I
  highlighted on Port Harcourt lifestyle with special focus on Gborokiri and
  Ikwerre lifestyles. I touched on the beauty of Ikwerre girls and the natural
  temptations that follow such beautiful girls, most of whom seem to be found in
  Port Harcourt Ghettos. O'laga Port is a reminder of what a young man could
  face when visiting or relocating to Port Harcourt as temptations abound (Too
  many beautiful black Chikalas in PH).

See some shakkies and thugs in the ghetto
I say make I call
Kpallas hear my intonation
I ask were she from
She say na Cairo destination
I look her ukwu shooting a shuffled riffle
Omo, I play careful
Bacause na Ikwere Casablanca.
I log out fast to check her pattern codeline
1300 hour

(Verse 2)
Abeg, abeg make you re-adjust
Me I no no say
You come from North
You come Port Harcourt
To sell groundnut

No be her fault
Na still her turn
To turn people cup
Very soon I know say she go somersault
Huuuuuuh!

Baby-girl I go carry you reach ghetto
Na when we reach ghetto say hello, hello
My brother all the nigger go zero
If you like you come the Ghetto
