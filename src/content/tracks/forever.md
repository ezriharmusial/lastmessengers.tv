(Intro)
Ah, oh na na
Baby I'm in love, Baby I'm in love
You make me make me fall in love

Cos I'm in love with you I feel like Shina Rambo
When I play with you I dey shine like Ronaldo
Make we live forever
This love dey make me gagaga
Shey you want to meet my mother, cos I wan love you forever

(Hook)
I will love forever
Me and you together
Nobody will understand how I love you
Nobody will understand how I love you

Them dey crase as we dey bubble
Them say see this kind of love wey no dey crumble
As I tell you yes the matter settle
Dey wan kill themselves because we no send them
Baby. Ayiii

As long as we dey mingle
Na so we go dey flow in any whether
Take this bundle

Baby I don't mind
If I fall in love

And that shows much that I really love u
And I promise
I promise to never hurt you
That shows how much I need you

Cos I'm in love with you I feel like Shina Rambo
When I play with you I dey shine like Ronaldo

This love dey make me gagaga
Shey you want to meet my mother, cos I wan love you forever

(Hook)

Me and you together
Nobody will understand how I love you
Nobody will understand how I love you
