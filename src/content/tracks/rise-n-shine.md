description: LastMessengerS Unity song titled Africa4Africa - Rise 'N' Shine is a
  wake-up call for Africans to resurrect from their age-long backwardness and
  dependency on foreigners.   The singers urged Africans to pay adequate
  attention to the deceivers who are out to fool them again.  Africa4Africa -
  Rise 'N' Shine is a song through which Africans are being awakened and
  realigned back to their ancient roots by taking care of what belongs to them
  instead of waiting for the Whites, Arabs and Asians to mismanage Africa's
  mineral and natural resources to the direct detriment of African families.  We
  know that this song has the potential to change African lives for
  good-forever.  Congratulations to the LastMessengerS

They know what they did they did what they know
Coveted Africa never-never gave a damn
looted our heritage en made away with trophies
caged Africans using many many lies
Divide and conquer is your only strategy
Many years are gone while we were all asleep
It's a new dawn en I hear the cocka crowing
It's 7 in the morning
make hey while the Sun shines

(Chorus by All)
Yes, we love you
we need you
Ooh rise 'n' shine
Do not let them fool you
Cause we wanna be
with you forever

(Rap by Skillful Kennis SK)

Let's unite to path no more
Africans, unite, unite, unite

(Chorus by All)
Yes, we love you

Ooh rise 'n' shine
Do not let them fool you
Cause we wanna be
with you forever

(Verse 3 by WhitneyZinny)
They lied, to us

(Verse 4 by WhitneyZinny)
I know, you know
