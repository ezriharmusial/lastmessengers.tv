description: Due to my little experience in life I’ve come to realize that humans
  need to be contempt with whatever life presents. Live a normal life having in
  mind that he ought to be thankful at all times to his maker whether it’s in
  good or bad times… Always be Thankful.   Mr Brown Beatz is a Ghanaian sound
  producer who produced Thank You and Destiny that both feature my very good
  friend and sight-challenged senior brother and colleague Uchekings. Both
  productions were finalized by producer Gee Kollins when he Traveled. He
  further produced More Again which was received by inspiration during my live
  band performances. He’s a very hard working young man and loves taking his
  time to get his job done. He equally produced other songs that are not not in
  this present album. I got in contact with him through my friend Torgbe, who
  features in his song Mr DJ.
