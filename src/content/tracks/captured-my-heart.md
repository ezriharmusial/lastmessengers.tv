description: This song shades light to the sweetness that comes with being in love
  and vice versa.  It tries to expose the clingy inherence  in the female
  gender, who envisages  relationships as a do or die affair and can go the
  extra mile to ensure it's continuity regardless of the abuses and weaknesses
  of their lover which only quitting can salvage.   It can also be likened to
  the Igbo's of Africa who have been begging to be recognized and loved and
  whose land have been raped economically and have resolutioned to quit.
