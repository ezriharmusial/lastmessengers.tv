quote: Palm wine is LoveTonic
description: With frustrating dismay, I have observed how Oyibo (the whites)
  succeeded in replacing our natural alcoholic Palm wines (Nkwu na Ngwo) drinks
  with their artificial drinks like Beer, Minerals, Malt, Hots, Wine etc.  I
  realized that Oyibo's gradual but steady replacement of our natural gifts with
  their artificial products has eaten deep into the marrow of Igbo people in
  particular and Africans in general.  I then decided to sing about this
  intentional CULTural damage done against Igbo people and Africans.  The whites
  (Oyibo) who have secretly been poisoning Africans (so-called blacks) did
  everything possible to prevent Africans from drinking the breast-milk of
  Nature (Palm wine) and get healed.  Through LoveTonic, I remind Africans that
  they have all been duped by Oyibo.

(Verse 1)
Inside my body,
It pains me so much
Oh girl I'm dying,
And I feel afraid to let go
Run through my spine,

Now cause,
I am not, I am not sorry,
For loving you, no
No more

(Bridge)
Girl, what have you given me?
Cause I am some kind of a dove
I know, it's a mixture,
Of love and care

(Chorus)
Love Tonic, you give me Love Tonic, girl
Can’t you see, believe it, girl I feel good
Love Tonic, this is the Love Tonic
Girl, girl

(Verse 2)
Before we sink deep.
In a place in your love.
For better or worse,
From my heart,
I would like to say,
Never gather from me, young girl,
I will, will always be,
By, by your side, 
Sugar

(Bridge)
Girl, what have you given me?
Cause I'm some kind of a dove
I know, it's a mixture,
Of love and care

(Chorus)
Love Tonic, you give me Love Tonic, girl
Can’t you see, believe it, girl I feel good
Love Tonic, this is the Love Tonic
Girl, girl

(Rap)
Just woke up alone,
Pride and joy like an Irish boy
I love with my soul, sugar
Living in the narrate of my voice,
I do feel, a better man

For better or worse,
Come with me girl
I promise

(Verse 3)
What did you give to me?
It's good for me
Oh girl I confess,
From my heart,
I do say, thank you, thank you

From this way up hill,
In my soul, in my soul

(Chorus)
Love Tonic, you give me Love Tonic, girl
Love Tonic, you give me Love Tonic, girl
Can’t you see, believe it, girl I feel good
Love Tonic, this is the Love Tonic

(Finale)
Girl, girl,
Girl, girl,
Love me, baby

Love Tonic, you give me Love Tonic, girl
Love Tonic, you give me Love Tonic, girl

I can’t believe it
Love Tonic, this is the Love Tonic
Love Tonic, the way is Love Tonic
Cherish Love Tonic
We need Love Tonic
I love Love Tonic
I need Love Tonic
Baby, oh please, love me
Really choose me girl
