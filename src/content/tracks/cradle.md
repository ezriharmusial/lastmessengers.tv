description: Although still young, I have witnessed what my mum and other mums go
  through while caring for their Children.   Since I have no other better way of
  expressing my profound gratitude towards my mother in particular and all
  mothers in general, I decided to use my Chi'Ukwu-Okike given talent as a music
  producer and a musical artist.  My song Cradle reminds everyone of the need to
  value and praise our mothers everyday and always.

(Intro)
Who sat and watched
My infant head
When sleeping on
My cradle bed
My cradle bed

(Verse 1)
If I better today na my mother
As you see me so I no get another
I de beg God make en keep am longer
As she de go omor I no go de wonder

(Chorus)
Chukwu biko gọzie
Ochie dike mama
Nna biko gọzie
Gọzie kwa nne m o
Gọzie kwa nne m o

(Verse 2)
If I de worry worry
She no de sleep at all oo
If I no chop
Omor she no go chop oo
If you get mama oo
All you do is pray for her
If your mama still de breathe eeh
Make you just de beg God for am
If I de cry she go tell me stop stop
Stubborn me I go de cry
I go de cry non stop, egbuola m oo
She carry you for 9 months
You suppose see the sign eeh
She de beg God for rainy days
She de beg God for better days
Wey go de give you grace eeh

Every woman deserves our respect.
