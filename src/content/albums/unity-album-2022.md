Following ArtKids® project for the sponsorship and promotion of highly talented but disadvantaged African musical talents,
ArtKids® Foundation has succeeded in gathering and sustaining these stars as a team

As a result, a total of 13 highly talented African male and female singers came together following the ongoing Africa4Africa Unity campaigns geared towards cementing an everlasting Love&Peace-oriented relationships among the presently disorganized dark-skinned and kinky-haired Africans.

This team of 13 singers took up the name 'LastMessengerS' vowing to reach Africans and the entire world with messages of Peace, Love, Unity and Progress this 2022.

With each member of the LastMessengerS donating 1 unity song by 13 members, 11 songs were compiled into Africa4Africa Unity Album 2022.

As if that wasn't enough, the LastMessengerS then wrote, composed and sang a special song to their fellow Africans with serious messages as its lyrics, making it 12 tracks in total. The title of this collectively sang track is Africa4Africa - Rise 'n' Shine.
