Press Release
11/11/2022

Africa4Africa - Rise 'n' Shine released this 11th day of the 11th month of 2022

Africa4Africa is the initiative of ArtKids® LastMessengerS. Africa4Africa covers various development projects in Africa and for Africans. Through our song (Rise 'n' Shine) we deliver life-saving messages and raise the needed funds to run Africa4Africa projects 2023.

The 'LastMessengerS' is a group of highly talented African musical artists who came together for the sole purpose of delivering vital messages to fellow Africans and friends of Africa worldwide; using music as conveyor.

Undoubtedly, Africans have suffered tremendously in the brutal hands of the Whites, Arabs, Asians and their African puppets called politicians.

Logically, the suffering of African people is coming to an end as Chi'Ukwu Okike (Elu na Ala=Chi na Eke) have intervened to rescue the entrapped dark-skinned and kinky-haired Africans (Ndi-Gbo)

Rise 'n' Shine is a message to all Africans worldwide to recognise the time in which we are living and wake-up from Oyibo hypnosis casted on them long before now

Listen to Africa4Africa - 'n' Shine and share it for our brothers and sisters worldwide to also hear this good news which is packaged as a melodious song.

The LastMessengerS will soon embark on a tour of Igboland for live performances.
