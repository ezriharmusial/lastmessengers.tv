metadescription: O'laga Port is creative Langwa rap (messages) through which I
  highlighted on Port Harcourt lifestyle with special focus on Gborokiri and
  Ikwerre lifestyles.  I touched on the beauty of Ikwerre girls and the natural
  temptations that follow such beautiful girls, most of whom seem to be found in
  Port Harcourt Ghettos.  O'laga Port is a reminder of what a young man could
  face when visiting or relocating to Port Harcourt as temptations abound (Too
  many beautiful black Chikalas in PH).
