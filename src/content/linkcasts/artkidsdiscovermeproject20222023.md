ArtKids速 Foundation is an in-Holland-registered and globally operational talent discovery, development, promotion, marketing and empowerment organisation with special focus on highly talented African youths.

DISCOVERY AND EMPOWERMENT OF AFRICAN TALENT

Chinedu Young Nwaneri a k.a Thinking Faculty - TF is from Umueke Villa in Owerre-Nkworji Community in Imo of Igboland

While everyone knows Thinking Faculty in Umueke and Owerre-Nkworji as a kind but stubborn and radical child, what no one knew was how musically talented Thinking Faculty -TF  is.

Until Thinking Faculty - TF was discovered by ZehkEzehk, the Executive producer  of ArtKids速 Audiovisual Studio; TF was roaming the streets causing troubles for himself and others.

Chinedu Young Nwaneri a.k.a Thinking Faculty - TF  graduated from the Federal University of Technology (FUTO) Owerri where he studied Polymer engineering

The lesson to learn from Thinking Faculty -TF; is that, no one is useless as the society erroneously stereotyped them to be.
Clearly, if carefully observed, we can discover those talents with which Chi'Ukwu Okike has blessed African youths.
Yes, talents pay more than University degrees.
Discover them young.
