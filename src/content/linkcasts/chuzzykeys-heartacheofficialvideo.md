Heartache concept:
Chuzzykeys was madly in love with Queen Mama and risked everything to have her as his GF.

Instead of clearly letting Chuzzykeys know that she was dating another guy (UG), she kept rejecting Chuzzy's advances.

Chuzzykeys did not give up. Against all odds and advice from his friends, Chuzzy continued chasing her, hoping that; one day, she will understand and accept him as her BF.

As Chuzzykeys sat with his friends, behold, the fresh and rich-looking UG was walking hand-in-hand, with Queen Mama as they walked past Chuzzy and his friends. 

For the first time, Chuzzy realized the reason why Queen Mama has been reluctant in reciprocating his romantic gestures. She's in love with UG.

Chuzzy's friends confirmed their suspicion that the girl wasn't interested in Chuzzykeys.

Surprised and frustrated with the reality, Chuzzykeys complained to his friends on how much he has invested in her; yet, fooled by her.

Chuzzy decided to call her just one more time. Meanwhile, UG had enough and was working towards leaving her. UG started avoiding Queen Mama by rejecting her calls.

Chuzzy placed the very last call to queen mama and was surprised Queen Mama picked and responded positively.

Appointment was booked and Chuzzy finally fell in love with Queen Mama.

The End.

Lyrics

(Intro)
Ah, yeah yeah yeah yeah

All the feelings wey I give you 
You tell me say make I no disturb you
All the loving wey I show you

(Chorus)
All these whining and the cunning 
Baby sorry, me I no dey take a funny 
All the cheating and the jonting
Baby sorry, me I no dey take am likely 

All my friends don dey tell me say 
Make I no fall oo say na set up oh
And your body don de blind eye 
All my feelings, Omor e too strong eh 

(Hook)
My baby don break my heart oh 
She don break my heart
My baby don break my heart oh
She don break my heart
My baby don scatter my heart oh
She don break my heart
My baby don gbaja my heart oh 
She don break my heart

(Verse 2)
You play me like a sancho
See my heart just de roll like ball
Blow me like Mike Tyson 
Like a scar and my heart don cast

Put body make I show you say I holy 
No be all dem girls wey dey talk say I naughty
Put body say my body don dirty

My baby, you know say me I love you 
My honey, no de do me cunny me I no like sharding 
All my money, for your body 
I go spend am oh weh eh

(Chorus)
All these whining and the cunning 
Baby sorry, me I no dey take a funny 
All the cheating and the jonting
Baby sorry, me I no dey take am likely 

All my friends don dey tell me say 
Make I no fall oo say na set up oh
And your body don de blind eye 
All my feelings, Omor e too strong eh 

(Hook)
My baby don break my heart oh 
She don break my heart
My baby don break my heart oh

(Outro)
No red flag, no red flag, no red flag
