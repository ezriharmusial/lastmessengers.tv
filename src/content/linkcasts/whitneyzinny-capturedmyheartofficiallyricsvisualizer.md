This song shades light to the sweetness that comes with being in love and vice versa.

It tries to expose the clingy inherence in the female gender, who envisages relationships as a do or die affair and can go the extra mile to ensure it's continuity regardless of the abuses and weaknesses of their lover which only quitting can salvage.

It can also be likened to the Igbo's of Africa who have been begging to be recognized and loved and whose land have been raped economically and have resolutioned to quit.
