A trimmed biography of Wizron can be read on our website: https://lastmessengers.tv/artists/Wizron 

Song concept: 
The singer took a closer look at Ego (money) and saw that although money is important in doing things and becoming rich, the fact is that no one should kill him or herself for money because money was on Earth before we were born, money will remain on Earth after our death.

Lyrics:
