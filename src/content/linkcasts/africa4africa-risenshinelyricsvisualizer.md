LastMessengerS Unity song titled Africa4Africa - Rise 'N' Shine is a wake-up call for Africans to resurrect from their age-long backwardness and dependency on foreigners. The singers urged Africans to pay adequate attention to the deceivers who are out to fool them again. Africa4Africa - Rise 'N' Shine is a song through which Africans are being awakened and realigned back to their ancient roots by taking care of what belongs to them instead of waiting for the Whites, Arabs and Asians to mismanage Africa's mineral and natural resources to the direct detriment of African families. We know that this song has the potential to change African lives for good-forever. Congratulations to the LastMessengerS

Africa4Africa Project:
Following ArtKids® project for the sponsorship and promotion of highly talented but disadvantaged African musical talents,

ArtKids® Foundation has succeeded in gathering and sustaining these stars as a team

As a result, a total of 13 highly talented African male and female singers came together following the ongoing Africa4Africa Unity campaigns geared towards cementing an everlasting Love&Peace-oriented relationships among the presently disorganized dark-skinned and kinky-haired Africans.

This team of 13 singers took up the name 'LastMessengerS' vowing to reach Africans and the entire world with messages of Peace, Love, Unity and Progress this 2022.

With each member of the LastMessengerS donating 1 unity song by 13 members, 11 songs were compiled into Africa4Africa Unity Album 2022.

As if that wasn't enough, the LastMessengerS then wrote, composed and sang a special song to their fellow Africans with serious messages as its lyrics, making it 12 tracks in total. The title of this collectively sang track is Africa4Africa - Rise 'n' Shine.

They know what they did ~they did what they know
Coveted Africa never-never gave a damn
looted our heritage en made away with trophies
caged Africans using many many lies
Divide and conquer~is your only strategy
Many years are gone while we were all asleep
It's a new dawn en I hear the cocka crowing
It's 7 in the morning
make hey while the Sun shines

Yes, we love you

Ooh rise 'n' shine
Do not let them fool you
Cause we wanna be
