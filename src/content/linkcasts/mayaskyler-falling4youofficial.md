About the song:

There has always been this taboo in Africa that; it's men who should approach women for relationship, not the other way.

Onuoha Ezinne Okpara a.k.a Maya Skyler via her hit R&B Single titled "Falling For You", argues that Patriarchy is the only reason why men believe they are superior to women.

Maya Skyler vowed and promised to be the first Igbo lady to openly encourage every African girl to fully express their feelings by freely approach the guy she eyes for relationship.
Listen as Maya Skyler shatters a long-believed Man-made Taboo.

Boy Iâ€™ve been Falling 4 You boy,
I just wanna be your one and o,
Only you fit to do me that eh

(Chorus)
Am Falling 4 You boy,
Boy Iâ€™ve been Falling 4 You boy,
I just wanna be your one and o,
Only you fit to do me that eh

(Verse 1)
I just wanna be the only one for you
Shea you no go break my heart if I fall for you
Shea you no go break my heart if I fall for you
I just wanna be the only one for you

Tell me how you do it,
How you made me fall for you,
Although I can't describe what I feel

All I know you make me gaga
I will be your baby mama,
You turn a bad girl into sinner,
Baby make I be your defender eh

This kind feeling, this kind feeling,
Oh baby me I need your
Deliverance healing
Oh am pleading

Everything you talk I do
Everything I promise do

What you want I buy for two
Common baby draw nearer
I will never cheat on you
You are the only one for me

(Chorus)
Am Falling 4 You boy,
Boy Iâ€™ve been Falling 4 You boy,
I just wanna be your one and o,
Only you fit to do me that eh

(Chorus)
Am Falling 4 You boy,
Boy Iâ€™ve been Falling 4 You boy,
I just wanna be your one and o,
Only you fit to do me that eh

(Verse2)
Boy Iâ€™ve been Falling 4 You
Na only you fit to make me turn on
Na only you fit to make me run around uh

This kind feeling, this kind feeling
I said me, I need your deliverance
Healing oh am pleading

Baby light up my candle
For your sake I go humble

Bad man tell me what you want from me,
I just wanna be the only one for you,
Shea you no go break my heart if I fall for you

(Chorus)
Am Falling 4 You boy,
Boy Iâ€™ve been Falling 4 You boy,
I just wanna be your one and o,
Only you fit to do me that eh

(Chorus)
Am Falling 4 You boy,
Boy Iâ€™ve been Falling 4 You boy,
I just wanna be your one and o,
Only you fit to do me that eh
