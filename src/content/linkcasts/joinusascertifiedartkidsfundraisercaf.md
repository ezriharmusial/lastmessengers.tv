Having released our Charity Single ~ Africa4Africa Rise 'n' Shine on the 11/11/2022, the question is every artists mind is; what next?

As nothing works in this 3D world without money, fundraising is the next.

For Africa4Africa charity single (Rise 'n' Shine), Album and Projects, every LastMessenger's artist and every member of the LastMessengerS is a fundraiser or event Host as an ArtKids Ambassador (AA)

ArtKids Foundation rewards fundraisers with 10% of the total amount raised. Why should you miss this opportunity?

While we will engage professional fundraisers, we think it's good to offer this opportunity to our members first before others.

If you are interested in representing LastMessengerS in your area as a Certified ArtKids Fundraiser (CAF) then join our Fundraising group.

Welcome in adv.
