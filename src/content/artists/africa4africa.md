# Histoy

It's quite unfortunate that those who are opportuned to have the money vehently refused to see music as a lucrative career. Instead they tend to force talents into professions they have no feeling for. They are happy that they can now sponsor themselves and other talented musicians to success.

Africa4Africa is a collaboration of artist connected to LastMessengerS Music, which is connecting Musical Talents, Managers, Promoters, Marketers and ICT/Media professionals together so as to reach the world with vital messages.

Granted, so many important messages are begging to be delivered to the public but our modern artists have deviated from the main goal of music, which are Revelations, Prophecies and Truths.

LastMessengerS artists both individually and through Africa4Africa, are restoring one of the ancient music values, TRUTH, by packaging messages as enjoyable songs, targeting the curious ears of the general public.
