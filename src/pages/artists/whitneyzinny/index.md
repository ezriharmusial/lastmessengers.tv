# Herstory

Her story started in 1995 when she joined the primary choir of her church and later the senior choir for adults owing to her love for music.

She went on to sing alto and then lower tenor, it was really a training ground for her because it made her sing some parts which she couldn't sing ordinarily and by practicing, she became consistent in some of them.

She left the choir owing to challenges and circumstances beyond her control and she never regretted been a chorister. She also joined a singing group known as Days Stars and Explicit Singers in church, which performed in church programs and at weddings.

Joining a group of local music artists was a big stepping stone for her, a full discovery of her full potential, it made her believe in her abilities and what she could offer through her art.

She is now preparing the launch of her professional music career.
