# History

Growing up he discovered his talent early in his primary education, when he started writing poems and songs. Blessed with a sweet and charming voice, he was sent to learn a trade in the northern part of Nigeria where he met a friend that introduced him to reggae music, which welcomed his spirit. From there he started following the steps of strong reggae pioneers like Royce, Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, but finally resorted to choose Lucky Dube as a mentor. He finds inspiration from the spirit of Yah above.

His story started in 1971 in Okigwe Province, now known as Abia State. He is the last son among the seven siblings who lost their second son in the Nigeria/Biafra war. He was brought up by his poor parents and couldn't complete his higher educational level for lack of financial support. 

With short dreadlocks on his head, he was later trained as an industrial electrician where he got a job with a private company which gave him the opportunity to start recording his songs bit by bit early 1998. He joined a group called Zoj Boys in the year 2001 when they released a single titled On My Own. He pulled out of the group because he couldn't see the light in it.

Two years later he came up with the album Jah Say No when he was known as Sicoraps at a time when reggae music started losing popularity in Nigeria. He then decided to move out to a foreign land to continue his musical career. When he got to Côte d'Ivoire in 2006, he joined the live band group The Morning Stars and was well known for copyrighting Lucky Dube on stage. Since Lucky Dube's death in October 18th 2007, he organizes a yearly memorial for his mentor which made him come up with the album What A System which included one of the tracks he dedicated to his mentor, titled Goodbye Lucky Dube.

And he never stopped there, born a peacemaker, kind-hearted, humble and a lover of freedom who never wanted to see people being humiliated or marginalized, he said that it is his mission to fight for the oppressed.

Da Reggae Priest was born a Catholic and was a member of the Catholic Charismatic Renewal Ci. He never gave up his faith in God. When he was asked about smoking and alcoholism he said: "Yeah I was doing it as a youth, I never knew that I got a supernatural strength in me from above but when I realized this, I called it a quits regarding my spiritual engagement to the Trinity." That is when he chose the name Da Reggae Priest, because the holy book made it clear that living in truth and holiness attracts the presence of Yah Almighty and his love shall rest upon you to give you the maximum strength and protection needed in all you do. 

Yah bless
